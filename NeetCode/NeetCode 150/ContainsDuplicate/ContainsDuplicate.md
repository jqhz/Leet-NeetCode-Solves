**Link:** https://neetcode.io/problems/duplicate-integer?list=neetcode150

---

## 1. Problem Restatement  
_Given an integer array, return true if there is more than 1 of any distinct number._  
- Input:  [1, 2, 2, 3]
- Output:  true
- Constraints & Edge‑Cases: none

## 2. Intuition / Insight  
_Why does this approach work?_  
- Key observation 1  
- Key observation 2  
- Why naïve solutions fail (e.g. O(N²) brute force)

## 3. Approach(es)  
### Approach A – Using a set/array  
1. adding to a set only keeps the unique digits .
2. we could use a set or an array since we are just checking if each number has already been seen before.
3. Step‑by‑step algorithm

## 4. Time & Space Complexity  
- **Time:** O(n)  
- **Space:** O(n)
